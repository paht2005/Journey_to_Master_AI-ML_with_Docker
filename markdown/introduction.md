## 🐳 What is Docker and Why It Matters in AI/ML
Docker is a lightweight containerization platform that enables packaging code, dependencies, and configurations into isolated units — containers. This ensures consistent environments for machine learning workflows across local, dev, and cloud setups.

### Benefits
- Reproducibility
- Environment isolation
- Easy deployment and scaling

## 🆚 Docker vs Virtual Machines

| Feature         | Docker             | Virtual Machines     |
|----------------|--------------------|-----------------------:
| Startup Time    | Seconds            | Minutes               |
| Resource Use    | Lightweight        | Heavy                 |
| Portability     | High               | Medium                |
| Isolation       | Namespace-level    | Full OS isolation     |
| Dev Workflow    | Scriptable         | Manual, slower        |

Docker is optimal for iterative ML development and deployment workflows.
