# 🧠 Journey to Master AI/ML with Docker
## 🚀 A Practical Handbook with 3 Hands-On Projects

---

## 📖 Introduction: Why Docker for AI/ML?
- What is Docker and why it matters in AI/ML
- Docker vs Virtual Machines
- Benefits for ML Engineers, Data Scientists, and AI Hobbyists
- How big companies (Netflix, Uber, NASA) use Docker in AI

---

## 🔧 Docker Essentials for AI/ML
- Images vs Containers
- Key Docker Commands (run, build, ps, logs, exec)
- Docker networking, volumes, and detached mode
- Lifecycle management

---

## 📦 ML Workflow & Toolchain with Docker
- Development: Jupyter, VS Code
- Tracking: MLFlow, DVC, Weights & Biases
- Serving: FastAPI, TorchServe, TensorFlow Serving
- Deployment: Docker Hub, Kubernetes, Hugging Face Spaces

---

## 🧪 Project 1: ML Notebook Lab with JupyterLabs & MLFlow
**Goal:** Run ML dev tools in Docker containers

- Launch MLFlow via container (`ghcr.io/mlflow/mlflow`)
- Launch Jupyter with volume mounts
- Sample Iris dataset notebook (Pandas + Scikit-learn)
- Logging experiments with MLFlow inside Jupyter
- **Skills gained:**
  - Volume mounts
  - Logs & exec access
  - Managing container lifecycles

---

## ⚙ Project 2: FastAPI Sentiment Classifier
**Goal:** Build and Dockerize a RESTful ML API

- FastAPI + HuggingFace Transformers
- Dockerfile walkthrough
- Build and run locally
- Test with Swagger UI (`localhost:8000/docs`)
- **Skills gained:**
  - Dockerfile creation
  - REST API containerization
  - Portable inference apps

---

## 🌐 Project 3: Tech Stack Advisor – ML App with Hugging Face Deployment
**Goal:** Build and deploy a full-stack ML app

- Train model with `train.py`
- Build Gradio UI (`app.py`)
- Manual container creation vs Dockerfile automation
- Push to Docker Hub
- Deploy to Hugging Face Spaces
- **Skills gained:**
  - App containerization
  - Docker image management
  - Public deployment via Hugging Face
